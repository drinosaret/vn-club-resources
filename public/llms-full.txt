> Learn Japanese with visual novels. Comprehensive guides, tools, VNDB browser, and community resources for immersion-based Japanese learning through VNs.

VN Club is a resource site for learning Japanese through visual novels (VNs). It provides step-by-step guides for text hooking, popup dictionaries, Anki mining, and other tools needed to read Japanese VNs. The site also features a VNDB browser, personalized recommendations, quizzes, and aggregated VN news.

The philosophy is immersion-first: read the original Japanese text from the start, using tools to assist comprehension rather than relying on translations. All tools covered (Textractor, JL, Yomitan) help read the original Japanese text, not bypass it.

## Core Concepts

Visual novel text hooking is the process of intercepting Japanese text displayed in a VN and making it available for dictionary lookups and Anki card creation. The typical setup involves:

1. **Text Hooker** (Textractor or Agent) — extracts text from the VN process
2. **Popup Dictionary** (JL or Yomitan) — provides instant word lookups with definitions, pitch accent, and frequency data
3. **Anki Mining** — creates flashcards from words encountered while reading, with sentence context
4. **OCR** (OwOCR or Meikipop) — for games where text hooking is not possible (images, console games)

The recommended learning path: learn kana → set up Textractor + JL → start reading a beginner VN → mine unknown words to Anki → gradually increase difficulty.
