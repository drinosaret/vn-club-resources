    "description": "Anki setup guide for Japanese learners. Configure FSRS scheduling, recommended settings, add-ons, and good habits for vocabulary retention with visual novels.",
    "content": "Anki Guide\r\n\r\nAnki is a spaced repetition flashcard program that helps you remember vocabulary long-term. It's one of the most powerful tools available for language learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant: Anki is designed for memory, not learning. You should encounter and understand words through reading VNs first, then use Anki to ensure you don't forget them. Don't try to learn entirely new concepts through Anki alone.\r\n\r\nInstallation\rDownload Anki from the official website\rChoose the Qt6 version (recommended for better performance and add-on compatibility)\rInstall and launch the application\rCreate a free AnkiWeb account for syncing across devices\r\n\r\nTip: Sync regularly by pressing the sync button or using the keyboard shortcut. This backs up your progress and lets you review on mobile.\r\n\r\nCore Concepts\r\n\r\nBefore getting started, make sure you understand these basic terms:\rDeck - A collection of cards (like a folder)\rCard - What you review (has a front and back)\rNote - The source data that creates cards (one note can make multiple cards)\rNew cards - Cards you haven't seen yet\rReviews - Cards you've seen before that are due for review\rLearning - Cards currently in the learning phase (not yet graduated)\r\n\r\nRecommended Deck\r\n\r\nFor beginners, start with Kaishi 1.5k. It contains ~1500 of the most common Japanese words with example sentences, specifically designed for immersion learners.\r\n\r\nTo install:\rDownload the  file from the link above\rDouble-click it or use File → Import in Anki\rThe deck will appear in your deck list\r\n\r\nAlternative: Core 2k/6k Deck covers more words but Kaishi is more beginner-friendly with better example sentences.\r\n\r\nPreferences\r\n\r\nBefore configuring deck options, check Tools → Preferences for global settings. For the most part, you don't have to change much here.\r\n\r\nReview tab:\rKeep V3 Scheduler enabled\rSet Next day starts at to a time before you wake up (I use 4 AM)\rIncrease Learn ahead limit to something high like 999 minutes to ensure all learning cards are seen within the day\rIf you're distracted by card counts, disable \"Show remaining card count\" and \"Show next review time\" (though having them visible helps verify intervals aren't obviously wrong)\rSet answer keys to whatever you prefer\r\n\r\nAppearance tab:\rUnder User Interface, you can toggle dark/light mode and increase the UI size if needed\r\n\r\nDeck Options\r\n\r\nAccess deck options by clicking the gear icon next to your deck, then selecting \"Options.\"\r\n\r\nEnable FSRS (Recommended)\r\n\r\nFSRS is Anki's modern scheduling algorithm that's more accurate than the default. It solves the \"ease hell\" problem where cards can get stuck in frustrating review patterns.\rGo to Deck Options\rScroll to the Advanced section\rEnable FSRS (this applies globally to all presets)\rSet Desired retention to 0.90 (90%)\rClick Optimize to let FSRS analyze your review history and tune itself to your memory patterns\r\n\r\nRe-optimize periodically (monthly, or after building significant review history) to keep the algorithm tuned to your memory patterns. The parameters are preset-specific, so optimize each preset you use.\r\n\r\nDesired retention controls what percentage of cards you'll recall correctly when they're due. Higher values mean shorter intervals and more daily reviews. Start with 0.90 and see how it feels. If the review load becomes too much, try lowering to 0.85. Stay between 0.85-0.95 for most learners. Going above 0.97 dramatically increases workload and defeats the purpose of spaced repetition.\r\n\r\nImportant: Only use Again and Good. Press \"Again\" when you forget, \"Good\" when you remember. Never press Hard when you forget a card. Hard is meant for \"I got it but it was difficult,\" not for failures. Pressing Hard on forgotten cards causes the algorithm to assign unreasonably long intervals. The PassFail add-on (listed below) removes Hard and Easy buttons entirely to enforce this simple workflow.\r\n\r\nNote: FSRS requires Anki 23.10 or later. Update if you don't see this option.\r\n\r\nFor more details, see the FSRS Tutorial.\r\n\r\nDaily Limits\r\n\r\nUnder the Daily Limits section:\rNew cards/day: Start with 10-15 (you can increase later once you're comfortable)\rMaximum reviews/day: Set to 9999 (effectively unlimited - never skip reviews)\r\n\r\nStarting with too many new cards leads to overwhelming review piles later. Be conservative at first.\r\n\r\nLearning Steps\r\n\r\nUnder the Learning section:\rLearning steps:  or  (single step is simplest and works well)\rAlternative:  or  for more exposure before graduation\r\n\r\nA single learning step is often sufficient. FSRS handles scheduling well once cards graduate, so you don't need many learning repetitions. The key rule: all steps must be completable in a single study session. Avoid steps longer than 12 hours, and never use day-long steps like .\r\n\r\nAuthor's settings: I personally use a single  learning step for new cards,  for relearning, and a leech threshold of 6.\r\n\r\nLapses\r\n\r\nUnder the Lapses section (for when you fail a card):\rRelearning steps:  or \rLeech action: Tag Only (don't suspend cards automatically)\r\n\r\nLeeches are cards you repeatedly fail. Tagging them lets you review and possibly rewrite them later instead of having them disappear.\r\n\r\nRescheduling (Use Sparingly)\r\n\r\nIn the FSRS settings, you'll see a \"Reschedule cards on change\" option. You can run this occasionally (every few months) to let FSRS re-optimize your intervals based on your review history. However, doing this too often isn't recommended. Rescheduling can cause a large batch of cards to become due all at once as intervals get recalculated. Most people leave it off day-to-day and only reschedule when they want a fresh optimization.\r\n\r\nAnki Philosophy\r\n\r\nI find that a lot of people don't know how to do Anki. This might seem a bit odd, as the workflow, at first glance, seems extremely easy. A card is presented to you, you attempt to recall it, you then press a button depending on your evaluation of how well you remembered the content on the back of the card. It seems simple, but despite this, I constantly come across people who say that Anki just \"doesn't work\" for them. Many of these people resort to paying money to make use of much less flexible (and much less efficient) learning systems such as WaniKani because they just can't seem to figure their way around the Anki application.\r\n\r\nFirst, let's get something straight: learning Japanese is absolutely free and you do not have to pay for anything to become able to read. Anki is a powerful program, and frankly, there is nothing that competitors can do that isn't possible with it, especially if you know the right extensions. So how do we use Anki effectively? How do I actually approach my reviews in a way that is effective? That is what I am going to cover here.\r\n\r\nTrust the Schedule\r\n\r\nThe first problem that I often see people face is that they don't do their reviews on the day that the scheduler assigns them for. If you are going to use Anki at all, this means that you have to trust the algorithm. This is a gross oversimplification, but the way Anki works is that the algorithm assigns cards to days where it thinks that there is a decent chance that you are about to forget it. If you completely ignore this scheduling and do cards whenever you want, you are not only building up the risk of growing an unmaintainable backlog, but also completely ignoring the way the application is intended to be used. Do not complain about having a low retention rate, or being unable to retain the contents of your cards if you are not doing your cards when the scheduler predicts that you must in order to achieve your designated target retention.\r\n\r\nHow to Know If You Know\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe previous problem is a simple one to fix and really only requires a bit of discipline, but there is another one that isn't really explored as often. How exactly do I even review my cards in the first place? I previously mentioned people leaving Anki for other platforms like Duolingo and WaniKani. Frequent users of Anki may be surprised to hear that this is even a problem for people, but some find doing Anki reviews unbearable because, by default, you are required to evaluate your own performance. Even more than the setup that is required to start using Anki, this single point is probably what filters the most people. I have seen it time and time again in language learning blogs and by language learning YouTubers who have given negative reviews to the application. They either do not feel comfortable evaluating their own performance, or just don't understand how to do it in the first place. After using Anki every single day for years, it's almost become second nature, but after some reflection, I can honestly see how this might be a bit of an issue at first. This is a hard question to answer! I'll say that how you decide to rate your cards is ultimately up to you, and there isn't just one way to do your reviews, but I want to give you some guidelines based on what I consider to be important to help guide you.\r\n\r\nGetting the Reading Right\r\n\r\nSo, let's take an example. Let's say we have a card with 食べる on the front. How do I know I know this word? Or rather, to what degree do I need to know this word to pass it? Well, let's get the easy stuff out of the way first. First, you must get the reading correct. For me, this is non-negotiable. If I do not get the reading correct, I will not pass the card. If you do not get yourself into the habit of ensuring you know the correct reading of words, you are essentially training yourself to not be able to understand words without kanji. You cannot pass 食べる as すべる because you remembered that 食べる means eat. Why? Because what really happened is that you remembered that the character 食 is related to eating and simply evaluated your understanding of the character. But that's a problem: when we are evaluating vocab words, we are not simply evaluating our understanding of kanji. Being able to recognize 食 and recall one of its meanings does no good for us in recalling the meaning of the word たべる as opposed to any other word. Even if you never intend to listen to or speak the language, this is important. Japanese, like any other natural human language, is generally not written with the assumption that you wouldn't know how to pronounce what is written.\r\n\r\nEvaluating Meaning\r\n\r\nWith that out of the way, let's get to the harder part. So, we've gotten past the first barrier: we have looked at the word 食べる, we are able to recognize that its reading is たべる. But we cannot say that we know a word just because we are able to read it. There's nothing stopping you from using Anki as a tool to only remember the readings of words, but for most, I think it is most practical that we, to some degree, make an attempt to remember its meaning as well. Firstly, almost no one would require themselves to be able to recite every dictionary definition verbatim. That's not only an incredibly difficult task but also time consuming, inefficient, and requiring way more than what is necessary to build basic comprehension in reading. What makes evaluating your recollection of meaning tricky is that, unlike readings, you really could ask a hundred people what something means and get a hundred different answers. How close does my answer have to be to the average person (or native speaker in this case) for me to rate a card as being correct?\r\n\r\nWell, a good start is being able to visualize the word, especially in the case of nouns. If I can clearly \"see\" a word, there is a good chance that I will be able to recall it in context. This is the easiest and fastest way to identify a \"known\" word. Visualization should be your first standard for evaluating your recollection of meaning. If you can \"see\" a word, you are probably good to pass it. Words that you aren't familiar with will be very hard to visualize. For example, if I see 林檎 and can immediately picture an apple in my mind, that's a pass. If I see the word and my mind goes blank, or I can only vaguely recall \"something about fruit maybe?\", that's a fail.\r\n\r\nSome concepts are harder to tackle. 掛ける has many meanings, with a lot of them being highly abstract. In cases like these, it might be a good idea to at least understand the \"base\" meanings, usually the first couple of definitions. You don't need to recite all twelve definitions of a word to pass it. If you can recall the core concept, you're fine. The more obscure usages will become clear through repeated exposure in your reading. Context does a lot of heavy lifting here. When you encounter 掛ける in an actual sentence, the surrounding words will usually make it obvious which meaning applies. Anki is just there to give you a foothold. Immersion does the rest.\r\n\r\nHere's some practical advice that has worked well for me:\rDon't overthink it. If you hesitate for more than a few seconds trying to decide whether you \"really\" know a word, you probably don't. A known word should feel automatic. If you're arguing with yourself, just hit Again and move on.\rWhen in doubt, fail it. It's better to see a card a few extra times than to pass cards you're shaky on. Passing cards you don't actually know just pushes them further into the future where you'll definitely forget them.\rRecognition is enough. You're training recognition, not production. You don't need to be able to use 食べる in a sentence from scratch. You just need to recognize it when you see it. Production comes naturally through immersion and output practice, not through Anki.\rTrust your gut. After a while, you'll develop an intuition for whether you know something or not. That slight feeling of uncertainty? That's your brain telling you the connection isn't strong enough yet. Listen to it.\r\n\r\nThe goal isn't perfection. You're not trying to build a mental dictionary with pristine definitions. Anki is just there to make sure you don't forget the words you've already encountered. The deeper understanding comes from seeing them over and over again in context while you read.\r\n\r\nQuick Lookups During Reviews\r\n\r\nWhen you fail a card or want to check a definition quickly, you can set up a dictionary to automatically look up whatever Anki copies to your clipboard. With the AJT Autocopy add-on (listed below), Anki will copy the word field when you reveal a card, and your dictionary will instantly show the definition.\r\n\r\nIf you're using JL, just enable clipboard capture in the settings and it will pick up words automatically. You can also press K during reviews to quickly look up the kanji on a card.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Yomitan users, open the Yomitan search page in your browser, enable clipboard monitoring in the settings, and set \"Clipboard text search mode\" to \"Search for definitions\" so it automatically looks up words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd-ons\r\n\r\nAdd-ons extend Anki's functionality.

    "content": "Learning Japanese with Visual Novels\r\n\r\nYour complete beginner's guide to reading Japanese VNs and games\r\n{ align=center }\r\n\r\nWhy Visual Novels Are Perfect for Learning Japanese\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVisual novels offer a number of unique advantages for Japanese learners that traditional textbooks simply can't match:\rExtensive reading practice - VNs contain thousands of lines of dialogue and narration\rNative audio - Many VNs are fully voice-acted by professional Japanese voice actors\rVisual context - Images and scenes help you understand situations and context\rEngaging content - You're learning through stories you actually want to follow\rInteractive learning - Choices and alternate routes keep you actively engaged\r\n\r\nUnlike textbooks (which are often unnatural and lack real context), VNs let you read at your own pace while experiencing real Japanese in natural contexts.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding Japanese Writing\r\n\r\nBefore getting started, it's helpful to understand what you'll be reading. Japanese uses three writing systems that work together:\r\n\r\nHiragana and Katakana (Kana)\r\n\r\nThese are the two phonetic scripts, each containing about 46 basic characters. They represent the same sounds but have different uses:\rHiragana - Primarily used for grammar particles, parts of words of Japanese origin, and native Japanese words\rKatakana - Used primarily for foreign loanwords (like コーヒー for \"coffee\"), slang, onomatopoeia, and emphasis\r\n\r\nAs phonetic scripts, once you learn them, you can read any kana text out loud, even if you don't understand the meaning.\r\n\r\nKanji (Chinese Characters)\r\n\r\nThese are logographic characters adopted from Chinese. Japanese uses about 2,000-3,000 common kanji in everyday writing.\rWhy kanji matters: Most content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives) are written using kanji. Unless you only plan on playing full-kana children's games, you need to learn them\rMultiple readings: Each kanji can have different pronunciations depending on the context\r\n\r\nHow they work together:\r\n\r\nA typical Japanese sentence mixes both kana and kanji. This might seem complex, but it's actually efficient once you get used to it.\r\n\r\nHiragana Chart\r\n\r\n| | a | i | u | e | o |\r\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\r\n| ∅ | あ a | い i | う u | え e | お o |\r\n| K | か ka | き ki | く ku | け ke | こ ko |\r\n| S | さ sa | し shi | す su | せ se | そ so |\r\n| T | た ta | ち chi | つ tsu | て te | と to |\r\n| N | な na | に ni | ぬ nu | ね ne | の no |\r\n| H | は ha | ひ hi | ふ fu | へ he | ほ ho |\r\n| M | ま ma | み mi | む mu | め me | も mo |\r\n| Y | や ya | | ゆ yu | | よ yo |\r\n| R | ら ra | り ri | る ru | れ re | ろ ro |\r\n| W | わ wa | | | | を wo |\r\n| N | ん n | | | | |\r\n\r\nKatakana Chart\r\n\r\n| | a | i | u | e | o |\r\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\r\n| ∅ | ア a | イ i | ウ u | エ e | オ o |\r\n| K | カ ka | キ ki | ク ku | ケ ke | コ ko |\r\n| S | サ sa | シ shi | ス su | セ se | ソ so |\r\n| T | タ ta | チ chi | ツ tsu | テ te | ト to |\r\n| N | ナ na | ニ ni | ヌ nu | ネ ne | ノ no |\r\n| H | ハ ha | ヒ hi | フ fu | ヘ he | ホ ho |\r\n| M | マ ma | ミ mi | ム mu | メ me | モ mo |\r\n| Y | ヤ ya | | ユ yu | | ヨ yo |\r\n| R | ラ ra | リ ri | ル ru | レ re | ロ ro |\r\n| W | ワ wa | | | | ヲ wo |\r\n| N | ン n | | | | |\r\n\r\nNotes: は = \"wa\" as particle, を = \"o\" as particle.

The moment you know kana and some basic grammar, you should be attempting to read. Yes, it will be overwhelming at first, but that's how you actually learn.\r\n    \r\n    If you've made the decision to learn Japanese, the best thing you can do is tell yourself that if you want to enjoy Japanese media, it must be in the original language. This separates people who make it from those who don't.\r\n\r\nThe Immersion-First Approach\r\n\r\nForget the traditional \"build foundations first\" approach. That's a trap that keeps you in textbooks forever. Instead, embrace the chaos of jumping in early. You'll be confused, you'll look up tons of words, and that's exactly what should happen.\r\n\r\nThink of it this way: when children learn their native language, they don't spend years studying grammar before attempting to understand stories. They're thrown into the language from day one, picking up patterns through exposure. The same principle applies here.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning, it may seem impossible, and the results of your efforts may not immediately be apparent. However, if you trust the process and make a serious effort to understand all Japanese text that you interact with, you will improve. If you instead keep telling yourself that you \"need\" translations, and that you're still \"not ready\" for real native content, you won't.\r\n\r\nYour actual timeline: Learn kana (1 week maximum), start the Kaishi 1.5k Anki deck, set up tools, and immediately start engaging with native content. Don't wait for some arbitrary \"readiness\" milestone that doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nStep 1: Master the Basics\r\n\r\nLearn Hiragana and Katakana (1 week maximum)\r\n\r\nKana is your gateway to everything Japanese, but don't overthink it. This should take a few days to a week at most, not weeks of perfectionist drilling.\r\n\r\nThe fastest approach is intense but effective: Immediately start practicing with the interactive kana game. Don't aim for 100% accuracy before moving on-you'll naturally improve through exposure to real Japanese text.\r\n\r\nHere's the key insight: you'll learn kana faster by seeing it in context (like in actual VNs) than by endlessly drilling isolated characters. Once you can recognize most kana even if slowly, you're ready to start reading. Speed and accuracy will come naturally through practice.\r\n\r\nThe perfectionist trap: Many learners spend weeks \"mastering\" kana before touching real content. This is backwards. Get comfortable with the basics, then let real reading solidify your knowledge.\r\n\r\nStart Building Vocabulary (Ongoing from Day 1)\r\n\r\nVocabulary learning should begin immediately and run parallel to your reading, not before it. The Kaishi 1.5k deck is specifically designed for this approach. It's the most beginner-friendly option available, and makes use of relevant example sentences.\r\n\r\nStart conservatively with 10-15 new cards daily. As you begin reading VNs, you'll discover which words appear frequently in your chosen content. This creates a powerful feedback loop: Anki introduces you to common words, and your reading reinforces them in context.\r\n\r\nThe great thing about starting to learn vocabulary alongside reading is that you'll immediately see Anki words appearing in your VNs. That moment of recognition when you come across a word that you have just learned is incredibly motivating and helps cement the vocabulary in your long-term memory.\r\n\r\nAlternative option: Core 2k/6k Deck covers the most common Japanese words, but Kaishi's beginner focus makes it more suitable for VN readers.\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is recommended to start learning vocabulary directly rather than studying individual kanji in isolation (like RTK or KKLC). Learning words with kanji in context is more practical and immediately useful for reading. If Kaishi feels too difficult, consider the RRTK450 deck as a bridge, but you don't need to spend months on isolated kanji study before starting real content.\r\n\r\nEssential Grammar Foundation (Ongoing)\r\n\r\nPrimary recommendation:\rTae Kim's Grammar Guide - Free, comprehensive, and practical. Tae Kim isn't perfect, but it's a quick read, which is why it's recommended. Start here for solid fundamentals.\r\n\r\nFor deeper understanding:\rIMABI - Incredibly detailed grammar explanations covering everything from beginner to advanced topics. IMABI is more accurate than Tae Kim but may be overwhelming for some. Use this when you need thorough explanations of complex grammar points you encounter in VNs.\r\n\r\nAlternative approaches:\rBunpro - SRS-based grammar learning with built-in reviews\rCure Dolly YouTube Series - Explains grammar from Japanese perspective\rSakubi - Structured grammar course with examples\r\n\r\nRemember: you will learn more grammar through actually making an effort to understand sentences in the wild than through any grammar guide.\r\n\r\nStudy approach: \rKeep reading grammar points while learning vocab\rFocus on understanding and recognizing patterns rather than rules\rAlways try to understand grammar in context\rDon't aim for perfection, understanding develops through exposure\r\n\r\nStep 2: Set Up Your Reading Tools (Do This Immediately)\r\n\r\nDon't delay tool setup because you'll need these from your very first reading session. The goal is to remove every possible barrier between you and Japanese text.\r\n\r\nEssential Software Setup\r\n\r\nYou'll need three core tools to start reading VNs effectively. Install them in this order for the smoothest experience.\rAnki - Your Vocabulary Foundation\r\n\r\n\r\n    While you can get really good at reading Japanese without Anki through interacting with native text, this spaced repetition system is a very powerful tool for retaining vocabulary you encounter in your reading.\r\n\r\nWhat it does: Ensures you actually remember vocabulary long-term through scientifically-optimized review scheduling.\r\n\r\nSetup: Follow our Anki guide for complete installation and configuration.\rDictionary Tool - Choose Your Lookup Method\r\n\r\nChoose between JL (recommended for VN readers) or Yomitan (browser-based alternative):\r\n\r\n\r\n    Best choice for most learners\r\n    \r\n    JL is specifically designed for Japanese learners reading visual novels. It offers the most streamlined experience for VN workflows.\r\n\r\n    Why choose JL:\rBuilt specifically for VN readers and learners\rWorks system-wide (no browser required)\rIntegrated Anki mining features\rReading statistics and progress tracking\r\n\r\n    Setup: Follow our JL guide for complete installation and configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Choose this if you prefer browser-based tools\r\n    \r\n    Select Yomitan if you prefer browser-based reading or need to look up text on websites frequently.\r\n\r\n    When to use Yomitan:\rYou prefer reading VNs in browser\rYou frequently look up text on Japanese websites\rYou want a more traditional dictionary extension experience\r\n\r\n    Setup: Follow Donkuri's Yomitan setup guide for complete installation and configuration.\rText Hooker - Your Text Extraction Engine\r\n\r\n\r\n    Text hookers like Textractor extract text from VNs so you can copy, look up, and mine vocabulary without manually typing Japanese characters.\r\n\r\nWhat it does: Hooks into VN processes and extracts displayed text in real-time for easy dictionary lookups.\r\n\r\nSetup: Follow our complete Textractor guide for installation and configuration.\r\n\r\nKey features: Compatible with most VNs, supports extensions, WebSocket integration for browser dictionaries\r\n\r\nAlternative tools: If Textractor doesn't work with your game, try Agent for script-based hooking or OwOCR for OCR-based text extraction.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Install tools in order: Anki → Dictionary Tool → Text Hooker. Each tool builds on the previous one for optimal workflow integration.\r\n\r\nThe Holy Trinity of Japanese Learning\r\n\r\n\r\n    📚 SRS ←→ 📖 Dictionary ←→ 🔗 Text Hooker\r\n\r\n    Anki ↔ JL / Yomitan ↔ Textractor / OCR\r\n\r\nThese three tools work together to create a powerful Japanese learning ecosystem: your text hooker extracts text from VNs, your dictionary looks up and mines vocabulary, and Anki ensures long-term retention. Each tool supports each other in a continuous learning cycle.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Jump Into Your First Visual Novel\r\n\r\nChoosing Content for Maximum Learning\r\n\r\nIt may be a good idea to pick something you're genuinely interested in reading, even if it seems challenging. If it feels like too much for you to handle, you can always put it on hold and come back to it later. Passion for the story will carry you through moments of confusion better than \"optimal\" difficulty ever could.\r\n\r\nRemember: you're committing to experiencing this story in Japanese, not just \"trying\" Japanese. This mindset shift is crucial. You're not using Japanese as practice for some future enjoyment; you're enjoying the medium through Japanese from day one.\r\n\r\nThat said, certain features make the learning process smoother. Furigana support (hiragana readings above kanji) is helpful for beginners. Modern, everyday language transfers better to other content than historical or fantasy vocabulary. Voice acting provides pronunciation models and helps with listening comprehension.\r\n\r\nLength is a psychological factor: finishing a shorter VN makes reading in Japanese feel achievable and builds confidence for longer works. But don't let length deter you from a story you really want to read. Better to struggle through something engaging than breeze through something boring.\r\n\r\nRecommended First VNs\rNanairo Reincarnation - Supernatural mystery with romance and comedy\rTsuyuchiru Letter - Yuri romance set in a prestigious girls' school\rGyakuten Saiban (Ace Attorney) - Also known as Ace Attorney in the west. The famous legal mystery series with engaging courtroom drama\rMarco to Ginga Ryuu - Extremely engaging, but short visual novel with tons of CGs\r9-nine- Series - Supernatural life-and-death drama. Starts out slow, but gets better towards the end\rTotono - Psychological romance involving a dramatic love triangle\rFamicom Detective Club - Classic murder mystery series. Available on the Switch and practically fully voiced\rSummer Pockets - Island summer story by Key. Long, but lots of slice of life content\rClannad - The classic Key drama\rKanon - The other classic Key drama\rAokana - Sports drama in a world with anti-gravity flying\r\n\r\nFree Options for Practice\rBrowse NovelGame.jp - Many free short VNs for practice\rCheck Freem! - Free games including visual novels\rTry web-based VNs - No installation required, good for testing setup\r\n\r\nStep 4: Reading Strategy and Building Sustainable Habits\r\n\r\nThe Core Philosophy: Serious Engagement from Day One\r\n\r\nRemember your commitment: if you want to enjoy Japanese media, it must be in the original language. This isn't about casual exposure or \"trying\" Japanese; it's about making a serious effort to understand all Japanese you interact with. You don't need to go \"AJATT\" or block out other languages, but you do need genuine engagement with the language. Resist the urge to reach for translations when things get difficult.\r\n\r\nDaily Reading Strategy\r\n\r\nStart Your Reading Sessions Right\r\n\r\nApproach each VN session with the mindset that you're experiencing a story in Japanese, not studying Japanese through a story. Have your tools ready, but don't let technical setup distract from the core activity: reading and understanding.\r\n\r\nThe Smart Lookup Strategy\rLook up words you see frequently - these give you the highest learning value\rLook up key story elements - names, important concepts, anything crucial to your understanding of the story\rDon't assume that you know the meaning of words - your intuition as a non-native speaker is not going to be perfect\r\n\r\nThe Importance of Comprehensible Input\r\n\r\nYour goal is \"comprehensible input\": content that you can mostly understand with some effort. This means you should be genuinely trying to comprehend what you're reading, not just passively consuming text. Avoid \"whitenoising\" (mindlessly reading Japanese without caring about comprehension) as this provides no learning benefit and can actually be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nThe sweet spot is content where you understand enough to follow the story but encounter enough unknown elements to learn from. If you understand almost nothing, the content may be too difficult. If you understand everything easily, you're not being challenged enough to grow.\r\n\r\nDon't get caught up in quantification and metrics. Some people get discouraged when they see low character counts or didn't read as much as they wanted that day, but these numbers don't define your progress. What truly matters is showing up consistently and making a serious effort to understand. Your comprehension and reading speed will naturally improve through regular exposure. Trust the process rather than obsessing over daily statistics.\r\n\r\nBuilding Vocabulary Through Mining\r\n\r\nWhat is mining?\r\n\r\nMining is the process of finding vocabulary in the wild (while reading VNs, playing games, etc.) and adding that vocabulary to a custom Anki deck for long-term retention.\r\n\r\nAs you read, you'll naturally encounter words worth learning. Mining vocabulary from your VNs creates personalized learning that's directly relevant to your interests.\r\n\r\nRemember: Anki is designed for memory, not learning. You want to mine words that are about 75% of the way there: words that seem useful and can actually be remembered after a couple exposures. The goal is finding that sweet spot between learnable, useful, and not super uncommon.\r\n\r\nSmart Mining Strategy:\rEncounter unknown word during reading\rLook up the word using JL or Yomitan's integrated lookup\rAsk yourself: Is this word learnable, useful, and frequent enough?\rMine only if it passes the \"75% test\" - you can grasp it and it seems worth remembering\rCreate Anki card with the sentence context from your VN\r\n\r\nThe \"75% Test\" - Mine words that are:\rLearnable - You can understand and remember them after a few exposures\rUseful - They appear frequently or are crucial to story understanding\rNot too obscure - Common enough that you'll see them again in other content\rFeel \"graspable\" - Something clicks when you look them up\r\n\r\nWhat NOT to Mine (Especially as a Beginner):\rWords that feel completely overwhelming or abstract\rExtremely rare or archaic terms you'll never see again\rTechnical jargon unrelated to your interests\rWords you consistently understand from context\r\n\r\nAdvanced Note: Once you reach higher levels, you can mine anything you don't know since your foundation is solid. But early on, be selective and focus on building that strong core vocabulary.\r\n\r\nFor detailed mining setup: Check out Donkuri's comprehensive mining guide for advanced mining workflows, note types, and technical setup guides. If you're using JL (our recommended dictionary), see our JL Anki integration guide for streamlined VN mining.\r\n\r\nBuilding Daily Consistency\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most important thing is showing up every day. When and how long you study matters less than never missing a day.\r\n\r\nDaily Reading: Your Primary Learning Activity\r\n\r\nRead your VN every day, even if just for 15-30 minutes. This is your main learning time, not a reward for completing other studies. Some days you'll read for 30 minutes, others for two hours. Let your energy and interest guide the session length, but try not to skip it entirely.\r\n\r\nDaily Anki: Non-Negotiable\r\n\r\nAnki is designed around daily completion and becomes significantly less effective if you miss days. The spaced repetition algorithm depends on consistent daily reviews to work properly. For the best results, complete your Anki reviews every single day: consistency beats intensity.\r\n\r\nIf your daily load becomes overwhelming, lower your daily new card count or adjust your target retention percentage in FSRS settings, but never skip your reviews.\r\n\r\nGrammar: As-Needed Basis\r\n\r\nLearning to read Japanese is very similar to the mindset of a programmer: when there's something you don't understand, you look it up. Grammar study should happen when you encounter something confusing, not on a rigid schedule. You'll learn more grammar through making an effort to understand sentences in context than through isolated study.\r\n\r\nThe Consistency Mindset\r\n\r\nYour daily engagement streak matters more than perfect sessions. Missing a day breaks the habit and makes it harder to restart. The goal is making Japanese interaction a daily habit, not achieving perfect study sessions.\r\n\r\nRecognizing Real Progress\r\n\r\nEarly Victories (First Month)\r\n\r\nThe first major milestone isn't comprehension, it's beginning to become comfortable with confusion. When you stop panicking about unknown words and start seeing reading sessions as entertainment rather than tests, you've made a crucial mental shift. This usually happens within the first few weeks of consistent reading.\r\n\r\nSuccessfully setting up your workflow and extracting your first VN text feels technical, but it's actually a huge psychological win. You have made your first step towards Japanese literacy.\r\n\r\nBuilding Momentum (Months 2-6)\r\n\r\nReal progress becomes visible when you start recognizing vocabulary from Anki appearing in your VNs. This creates a positive feedback loop that accelerates learning. Another key milestone is reading for extended periods without mental fatigue; your brain is adapting to processing Japanese naturally.\r\n\r\nCompleting your first VN, regardless of comprehension level, represents a massive achievement. You've proven to yourself that it is possible for you to read in Japanese and that it is an enjoyable activity, not an impossible challenge.\r\n\r\nLong-term Development (6+ months)\r\n\r\nEventually, reading shifts from being a mere part of your study routine to entertainment. You'll choose VNs based on interest rather than difficulty level. This transition from learning Japanese to learning through Japanese marks true immersion success.\r\n\r\nRemember: these timelines are rough guides, not rigid requirements. Your progress depends on consistency and genuine engagement, not speed. Focus on building sustainable habits rather than hitting arbitrary milestones.\r\n\r\nDealing with Challenges\r\n\r\nWhen you feel overwhelmed:\rTake breaks as needed\rReview your Anki cards to reinforce known vocabulary\rRe-read previous sections for confidence\rRemember: confusion is part of the learning process\rIf your daily Anki load feels too heavy: Lower your daily new card count or adjust your target retention percentage in FSRS settings, but try not to skip your reviews\r\n\r\nWhen progress feels slow:\rTrack your reading sessions to see consistency over time\rNotice vocabulary you now recognize that was once unknown\rRemember your commitment to experiencing Japanese media in its original language\r\n\r\nRemember:\rEvery Japanese sentence you read makes the next one easier\rProgress isn't always visible, so trust the process\rComparing yourself to others is counterproductive\rThe journey is part of the reward, so enjoy it as much as you can\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Read more.\" – Everyone who made it\r\n\r\nQuick Start Checklist\r\n\r\nReady to begin? Here's your immediate action plan:\r[ ] Day 1-3: Learn kana basics with charts and the kana game\r[ ] Day 4-5: Install and configure JL (or Yomitan) + Textractor\r[ ] Day 6-7: Download Kaishi deck, start Anki, choose your first VN\r[ ] Week 2: Begin reading your chosen VN daily (even if it's confusing at first)\r[ ] Week 3+: Develop consistent daily routine of Anki + VN reading\r[ ] Month 1+: Start mining vocabulary from your VNs as you encounter interesting words\r\n\r\nThe key insight: You're not preparing to learn Japanese, you're learning it from day one. Every day you delay reading is a day of lost progress.\r\n\r\nMost important: Embrace the chaos of jumping in early. You'll be confused, overwhelmed, and frequently lost, and that's exactly how language learning works. Start today, stay consistent, and trust that understanding comes through exposure, not preparation. But don't worry, you will make it!\r\n\r\nInfluential Japanese Learning Guides\r\n\r\nThis guide draws inspiration from several excellent resources in the Japanese learning community.

You can:\rMove and resize: Click and drag the window to change its position and resize it however you like\rAdjust opacity: Click the first icon in the top left to reveal a slider for window opacity\rAdjust text size: Click the \"T\" icon to adjust the size of the text\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nText Input Configuration\r\n\r\nBefore we start importing additional dictionaries, let's first make sure that the program can receive text either from the clipboard or from a websocket:\r\n\r\nClipboard capture (default): By default, JL receives text from the clipboard, so by copying any text to your clipboard, you will be able to verify that it is working.\r\n\r\nWebSocket capture: If you have configured Textractor or another texthooker to automatically copy text to the clipboard, the JL window will automatically be populated with the extracted text. If you are making use of a websocket with your texthooker, you can enable JL to receive text from it:\rRight-click on the main JL window\rOpen preferences\rUnder \"Main Window,\" enable \"Enable WebSocket text capture\"\r\n\r\nThe websocket server address that you need to use will differ depending on the plugin or program you are using, but the default of  will work with textractorwebsocket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBasic Functionality\r\n\r\nDefault Interface\r\n\r\nOnce JL is receiving text from the clipboard or websocket, you can use it as a pop-up dictionary. By default, the \"lookup mode\" (found under \"General\" in preferences) is set to \"mouse move.\" Just move your mouse over a word to look it up.\r\n\r\nDictionary entry display: Each dictionary entry displays:\rThe word and its reading\rA speaker icon (for pronunciation if available)\rA frequency number\rThe dictionary name\rA plus icon to add the word to Anki\rThe definition content\r\n\r\nMining mode: The pop-up will show the most relevant results, but sometimes not all results fit in the window. To see everything, enter \"Mining mode\" by either:\rPressing the  hotkey\rClicking the middle mouse button (more convenient)\r\n\r\nIn mining mode, you will be able to scroll through the full list of results. By default, it will show results from all dictionaries, but you have the option to filter by dictionary by selecting the name of the dictionary at the top of the window.\r\n\r\nOther Lookup Modes\r\n\r\nMouse click/Touch: Disables the preview screen that appears when mousing over the text and brings you straight into the full list of dictionaries whenever you click on a word with your mouse. As the name implies, this setting is also useful for touchscreens, allowing you to easily look up words by simply tapping on them.\r\n\r\nText Select: Requires you to click and drag to highlight the text that you want to look up, bringing you straight into mining mode.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdding Additional Dictionaries\r\n\r\nPreparation\r\n\r\nBefore you start adding dictionaries to JL:\rCreate a new folder to hold the dictionaries you wish to use\rExtract each dictionary's zip file to its own folder\rEnsure the index and term bank JSON files of each dictionary are found at the root of each extracted folder\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdding Word Dictionaries\r\n\r\nAdditional dictionaries can be added to JL:\rRight-click on the main window and select \"Manage dictionaries\"\rFrom the new window that pops up, select \"Add dictionary\" from the top\rSelect a dictionary format and type\r\n\r\nDictionary types: Assuming you are using Yomitan format dictionaries, you can leave the format as is for now and select a type. Conveniently, dictionaries from Marv's collection are labeled by type, so depending on the label, you will know which to select. Dictionaries listed as  and  can be added as word dictionaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnderstanding Kanji Dictionary Types\r\n\r\nOne thing you need to pay attention to is the difference between a dictionary listed as \"Kanji Dictionary\" and \"Kanji Dictionary with Word Schema.\" Both will appear under JL's \"Kanji Mode\" whenever the associated hotkey ( by default) is pressed. However:\rKanji Dictionary: Dictionaries that appear under the kanji tab of Yomitan (the window that opens when you click on a specific kanji) should be added as \"Kanji Dictionary\"\rKanji Dictionary with Word Schema: Dictionaries that are still technically for kanji but appear among regular dictionary entries should be added as \"Kanji Dictionary with Word Schema\"\r\n\r\nIdentifying Dictionary Types\r\nYou can also check the extracted file directory to determine the dictionary type:\rKanji Dictionary: Contains files titled , , etc.\rKanji Dictionary with Word Schema: Contains files titled , , etc.\r\n\r\n|  |  |\r\n|:---:|:---:|\r\n| Add as Kanji DictionaryShows in kanji tab only | Add as Kanji Dictionary with Word SchemaShows among word entries |\r\n\r\nSimilarly, only dictionaries added as name dictionaries will come up when the associated hotkey to trigger \"Name mode\" is pressed. You can see the full list of \"modes\" with their associated default hotkeys below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDictionary Configuration\r\n\r\nAdding your dictionary:\rAdd the path to where you extracted it to \"Path\"\rUnder \"Name,\" give it a unique identifier\rConfigure the three available options:\rStorage: Store dictionary data in either a database or memory (database is recommended for most users as it reduces memory usage)\rNewline between definitions: Controls whether each definition appears on a new line for better readability\rDon't show results under all: Hides this dictionary's results when viewing the combined results from all dictionaries\rClick \"OK\" to add the dictionary\r\n\r\nOrganization: Once you have added your dictionaries, you will be able to organize them however you want by pressing the up and down arrows to the left of the name of each dictionary. Additionally, you will be able to edit the previous settings for each dictionary at any time.\r\n\r\nAuto-Updates\r\nThe built-in dictionaries (JMdict, Kanjidic, JMnedict) have special settings, particularly JMdict.\r\nAdditionally, any dictionary that is able to be auto-updated with Yomitan can now be auto-updated in JL as well. This extends JL's update capabilities to any compatible dictionary that supports automatic updates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdding Frequency Dictionaries\r\n\r\nTo add frequency dictionaries, you must add them separately through a different window:\rReturn to the main window, right-click, and open \"Manage Frequencies\"\rSelect whether the frequency dictionary is for words (appears with normal definitions in Yomitan) or for Kanji (only appears on the Kanji tab)\rPay attention to the last option, which should be checked in the case that you have a frequency dictionary where the frequency number actually lists occurrences rather than a ranking where a smaller number indicates the word or kanji being more frequent\r\n\r\nMost frequency dictionaries use a ranking format, so you should be able to leave this setting alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdding Audio Sources\r\n\r\nTo begin adding audio sources:\rReturn to the main menu, right-click on the window, and select \"Manage Audio Sources\"\rClick the button at the top labeled \"Add audio source\"\rYou can now add audio sources just like you would in Yomitan\r\n\r\nLocal Audio Server\r\n\r\nIf you are using the Local Audio Server for Yomitan:\rSet the audio type to \rUse the following URL:\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOnline Sources\r\n\r\nOnline sources like JapanesePod101 can be added in a similar manner:\rSet the audio type to \rEnter a URL (this one should already be there by default):\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nText-to-Speech\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can add any text-to-speech engines that you have installed on your system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnabling Anki Integration\r\n\r\nPrerequisite\r\nIf you don't already have Anki configured, I suggest you take a look at this page from Kuri's guide for more information.\r\n\r\nBasic Setup\r\n\r\nTo be able to mine words with JL, you need to configure some additional settings:\rRight-click on the main window, click on preferences\rNavigate to the \"Anki\" tab\rEnable the setting labeled \"Enable Anki integration\"\r\n\r\nAssuming you have AnkiConnect installed, the default server address should work just fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeck Configuration\r\n\r\nThe lower part of the window where you can start configuring your Anki cards will now be open:\rSelect your deck: If you don't see your decks after clicking on the dropdown window under \"Deck,\" try clicking the \"Refresh\" button until they appear\rChoose note type: Under \"Note Type,\" select the note type that your cards will use\rConfigure fields: Select Get Fields if they have yet to appear\r\n\r\nOnce the fields of your card appear, you can start configuring your cards however you like. The information you need to send to each field will depend entirely on the note type you are using.\r\n\r\nField Configuration Reference\r\n\r\nIf you click on the Info button, you will get the following list of the applicable settings:\r\n\r\n| Field Name | Description |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| Selected Spelling | The primary spelling or the selected reading you click to mine the word. |\r\n| Primary Spelling | The spelling you click to mine the word, e.g., if you look up \"わかりました\", its primary spelling will be \"分かる\". |\r\n| Primary Spelling with Orthography Info | The spelling you click to mine the word with its orthography info, e.g., if you look up \"珈琲\", its value will be \"珈琲 (ateji)\". |\r\n| Readings | Readings of the mined word, e.g., if you look up \"従妹\", its value will be \"じゅうまい、いとこ\". |\r\n| Selected Reading | If you selected a reading to mine the word, it will be that reading; otherwise, it will be the first reading of the mined word. |\r\n| Readings with Orthography Info | Readings of the mined word with their orthography info, e.g., if you look up \"従妹\", its value will be \"じゅうまい、いとこ (gikun)\". |\r\n| Alternative Spellings | Alternative spellings of the mined word, e.g., if you look up \"わかりました\", its value will be \"解る、判る、分る\". |\r\n| Alternative Spellings with Orthography Info | Alternative spellings of the mined word with their orthography info, e.g., if you look up \"嫁\", its value will be \"娵 (rK)、婦 (rK)、媳 (rK)\". |\r\n| Definitions | Definitions of the mined word.

There are currently four pitch accent categories: Heiban, Atamadaka, Odaka, and Nakadaka. |\r\n| Entry ID | JMDict entry ID. |\r\n| Local Time | Mining date and time expressed in local timezone. |\r\n\r\nExample Configuration\r\n\r\nFor reference, I've provided some basic settings that will work with the lapis note type for Anki below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Settings\r\n\r\nThe above information covers everything that you need to get started, but JL is a highly customizable program. Here are some additional settings in the preferences menu that might be of interest:\r\n\r\nGeneral Settings\rTheme: You can change the theme of the settings menus from dark mode to light mode if you wish\rLookup requires Lookup Key press: If you are used to having to press a key on your keyboard to look up a word, you can set it under \"Lookup Key.\" Personally, I enjoy the mouse-only flexibility of JL, so I keep this option unchecked\rAuto-play audio: This will automatically play the pronunciation of a word whenever you look it up. It might be a bit annoying in mouse move mode\r\n\r\nMain Window Settings\rFont: You can set the font to any that you have installed on your system\rDynamic width/Dynamic height: Automatically changes the size of the main window to fit all text in it. You can disable this if you find it annoying\rAuto reconnect to WebSocket: It's probably useful to turn this on if you are using WebSocket\rOpacity/Opacity on unhover: You can set default values for the opacity of the main window when your mouse is on top of it and when it isn't. Personally, I have the opacity set to 100 when it is and set to a low value when it isn't, so that the window is less of a distraction when I'm not using it. (Make sure to enable \"Change opacity on unhover\" if you wish to emulate this.)\rText only visible on hover: Similar to the opacity settings, enabling this will help make the window less conspicuous when you aren't actively using it. I usually have this enabled\rText-to-speech on text change: This will make JL read out every single line to you. If you can't tolerate the default Windows TTS engines, consider trying out a high-quality one like Voicevox\r\n\r\nPopup Settings\rFont: You can also set a custom font for the popup. It can be different from or the same as the one you set for the main window\r\n\r\nAdvanced Settings\rTrack the lookup count of each term: Tracks how many times you have looked up each word. This is visible in the stats menu by pressing the button next to \"Number of lookups\"\rSearch URL: You can change the search feature (pressing the S key, or selecting search from the right-click menu after highlighting text) to use a search engine other than Google. Just take any search query and replace the search term with  in the URL\r\n\r\nFor any other questions or issues, you can check the JL GitHub repository for more information or to open an issue.\r\n\r\nRelated Pages\r\n\r\nGetting Started:\rComplete Beginner's Guide - Full roadmap for learning Japanese with VNs\rTextractor Setup - Extract text from visual novels to use with JL\r\n\r\nAnki Integration:\rMain Guide: Mining Section - Learn how to mine vocabulary from VNs\r\n\r\nAlternative Tools:**\rTools Overview - See all available dictionary and learning tools",

    "content": "Magpie Guide\r\n\r\nThis guide walks you through setting up and using Magpie, a lightweight window upscaling tool that can dramatically improve the visual quality of older visual novels and games.\r\n\r\nMagpie applies advanced scaling algorithms to windowed applications, making low-resolution content look crisp on modern high-resolution displays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements\rWindows 10 (version 1903 or later) or Windows 11\rDirectX feature level 11\rA visual novel or game\r\n\r\nInstallation\rDownload the latest release from the Magpie Releases page\rExtract the downloaded archive to a folder of your choice\rRun  to start the application\r\n\r\nBasic Usage\r\n\r\nHotkeys\r\n\r\nMagpie can upscale windows in two different modes:\rFullscreen - Scales the window to fill your entire screen\rDefault hotkey: \rWindowed - Scales the window while keeping it windowed\rDefault hotkey: \r\n\r\nQuick Start\rLaunch Magpie\rLaunch your visual novel or game\rClick on the game window to make it active\rPress  for fullscreen scaling, or  for windowed scaling\rPress the same hotkey again to deactivate scaling\r\n\r\nBefore scaling:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter scaling:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScaling Algorithms\r\n\r\nMagpie includes many scaling options. Here are the most relevant for visual novels:\r\n\r\nBest for VNs:\rCuNNy - The go-to choice for VN artwork. Handles illustrated characters and backgrounds beautifully (recommended)\rAnime4K - Works well on VN sprites. Multiple variants for different needs\rACNet - Can clean up grainy or compressed CGs while upscaling\r\n\r\nIf CuNNy is too slow:\rFSR - Much faster but still looks decent. Good fallback for weaker hardware\rLanczos / Jinc - Classic algorithms that work on anything\rFSRCNNX - Balance between quality and speed\r\n\r\nFor PC-98 and older VNs:\rCRT shaders (Easymode, Geom, Hyllian, Lottes) - Give that authentic retro look if you're playing classic titles\rxBRZ / MMPX - Smooth out pixel art while preserving the aesthetic\rPixellate / SharpBilinear - Keep pixels sharp without blurring\r\n\r\nOptional post-processing:\rCAS - Quick sharpening pass\rAdaptiveSharpen - Brings out soft details without overdoing it\rSMAA / FXAA - Reduce jagged edges on text and UI elements\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n\r\nRecommended Settings for VNs\r\n\r\nFor visual novels, CuNNy tends to give the best results. It was specifically designed with VN-style artwork in mind.\rCuNNy-NVL - Tuned for the kind of art you see in VNs. Start here\rCuNNy-DS - Includes extra cleanup if your source looks noisy or soft\rCuNNy-fast - Try this if your GPU struggles with the standard version\r\n\r\nThe variants with larger numbers (8x32, 4x32) look nicer but are more demanding. If you're getting stuttering or low framerates, drop down to a smaller or \"fast\" variant.\r\n\r\nTo enable CuNNy:\rOpen Magpie and go to any of your profiles\rUnder the General section, find the Scaling mode setting\rChange the scaling mode to a CuNNy variant\r\n\r\nProfiles\r\n\r\nMagpie allows you to create multiple profiles with different settings like scaling mode and capture method. You can switch between profiles depending on what works best for each game.\r\n\r\nGraphics Card Selection\r\n\r\nIf you have multiple graphics cards (e.g., integrated and dedicated GPU), you may need to select the correct one:\rOpen your profile settings\rGo to the Performance section\rSelect your preferred graphics card\r\n\r\nThis is important for getting the best performance, especially on laptops with both integrated and dedicated graphics.\r\n\r\nTroubleshooting\r\n\r\nTip: For older games, try disabling DPI scaling overrides in the game's compatibility settings before using Magpie.\r\n\r\nIf a game has built-in resolution options, it may be best to use the game's native settings rather than Magpie's scaling.\r\n\r\nRelated Pages\r\n\r\nDisplay Tools:\rTools Overview - See all available VN tools including other display utilities\r\n\r\nGetting Started:\rComplete Beginner's Guide - Full roadmap for learning Japanese with VNs\rWhere to Get VNs - Find visual novels to play\r\n\r\nEssential Setup:\rTextractor Guide - Set up text hooking\rJL Dictionary Guide - Dictionary for reading VNs",

    "content": "Neko Project II Guide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PC-98 is home to a lot of classic visual novels and adventure games that never made it to modern platforms. If you want to play these in Japanese with text hooking support, you'll need an emulator. This guide covers setting up NekoProject 21/W (NP21W), which is the most accurate option available and supports text extraction for dictionary lookups.\r\n\r\nMuch of the setup portion of this guide is based on PC-98 Emulation For Beginners by PC-98 Bot. If you run into issues or want more detail on any step, check out their comprehensive guide.\r\n\r\nI'm going to assume you're already familiar with tools like Textractor and dictionary software. If you're just getting started with learning Japanese, check out our main learning guide first.\r\n\r\nWhat You'll Need\r\n\r\nRequired Downloads\r\n\r\nBefore we begin, grab these files:\rNeko Project 21/W - The most accurate PC-98 emulator. You need ver0.86 or later for text hooking to work.\rnp2fmgen - An alternative build with useful speedup features. I recommend having both.\rTextractor - For extracting Japanese text from games\r\n\r\nOptional but Recommended\rYAHDI.zip - Pre-configured hard disk image for CD games\rFONT.ROM - Improved font file for better text readability\rDictionary software - JL, Yomitan, or similar (see our JL guide)\r\n\r\nSetting Up Neko Project 21/W\r\n\r\nDownload the latest version from the NP21/W download page, unzip it, and run  once to generate the config file.\r\n\r\nRecommended Settings\rEmulate → Configure: Set CPU multiplier to 42 (reduce to 32 if you're experiencing slowdown), Sound Sampling Rate to 88200Hz\rEmulate → Font: Load the improved FONT.ROM for better text readability\rDevice → Sound Option → Mixer: Change FM from 64 to 128\rScreen → Screen Option: Enable 'Use skipline revisions' at 255 if scanlines make text hard to read\r\n\r\nOther Settings of Note\rEmulate → Configure: Enable \"Allow resize\" and \"Save window size\". Under Sound, you can change the type from DirectSound to WASAPI or ASIO\rEmulate → Reset/Pause: Use these to restart or pause emulation\rOther → Calendar: Set to your real time (localtime) or use a virtual calendar\rWindow icon menu: Click the icon in the top-left of the window for display options like window snap, restore window border, and preset resolution sizes\r\n\r\nLoading and Playing Games\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPC-98 games come as floppy images (.HDM, .FDD), hard disk images (.HDI, .NHD), or CD images (.ISO, .CUE). When available, always choose HDI/NHD files over floppies since they're pre-installed and don't require disk swapping.\r\n\r\n| Format | Where to Load | Notes |\r\n|--------|---------------|-------|\r\n| Floppy (.HDM, .FDD) | FDD1 slot | May require disk swapping |\r\n| Hard Disk (.HDI, .NHD) | IDE #0 | Recommended when available |\r\n| CD (.ISO, .CUE) | IDE #2 | Set IDE Option: Primary=HDD, Secondary=CD-ROM |\r\n\r\nAfter loading, go to Emulate → Reset to boot. If a game doesn't autoboot, type  to see files and run the .BAT file manually.\r\n\r\nFor CD games without an HDI file, use YAHDI as a universal boot disk.\r\n\r\nSetting Up Text Hooking\r\n\r\nThis is the important part for Japanese learning. Without text hooking, you won't be able to use dictionary lookups or mine vocabulary efficiently.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't installed Textractor yet, follow our Textractor guide first.\r\n\r\nEnable Text Hooking Support\r\n\r\nOpen  (found in the same directory as ) and add these lines under the  section:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  line is what enables text hooking support. Without it, Textractor won't be able to hook into the emulator at all.\r\n\r\nConnecting Textractor to NP21/W\rStart both  and \rIn Textractor, click Attach to game and select  from the process list\rClick Add hook and enter: \rClick OK (you should see a message like: )\rLoad a game in NP21/W that displays Japanese text\rIn Textractor, open the \"UserHook#\" entries and try each one. Look for lines like . The correct hook is often the last entry.\r\n\r\nTroubleshooting Text Hooking\r\n\r\nText Not Appearing: Make sure  is in your . Try different UserHook entries in Textractor. Make sure the game is actually displaying text.\r\n\r\nGarbled Text: Install the improved FONT.ROM file. Check that your system supports Japanese text display.\r\n\r\nHook Not Working: Verify you're using NP21/W ver0.86 or later. Restart both programs and try the connection again.\r\n\r\nMissing Text: Certain games might not hook all text perfectly. Use OCR tools like OwOCR as a backup when text hooking fails.\r\n\r\nMultiple Text Outputs: Some games output the same text multiple times. Just look for the cleanest, most complete version in Textractor.\r\n\r\nOther Useful Features\rSave States: With  in your config, you get a Stat tab with 10 save slots\rMouse Control: Press F12 or Middle Click to control the internal mouse cursor\rGame Speed: Lower the CPU multiplier if games run too fast, increase if too slow\rGDC Issues: If graphics are corrupted, hold End while resetting and change GDC from 5MHz to 2.5MHz in ディップスイッチ２\r\n\r\nResources\rNeo Kobe Collection - Primary source for PC-98 games\rPC-98 Series Central Discord - Active community for help and discussion\r9800guide - Comprehensive PC-98 information\rPC-98 Emulation For Beginners - Detailed setup FAQ and troubleshooting\r\n\r\nRelated Pages\r\n\r\nGetting Started:\rComplete Beginner's Guide - Full roadmap for learning Japanese with VNs\rTextractor Setup Guide - Essential for PC-98 text extraction\r\n\r\nTools:\rJL Dictionary Guide - Dictionary setup for Japanese lookups\rOwOCR Guide - OCR backup for unhookable text\r\n\r\nMore Resources:\rWhere to Get VNs - Find PC-98 and modern visual novels\rTools Overview - All VN learning tools",

    "content": "OwOCR Guide\r\n\r\nA simple guide on how to quickly set up and use OwOCR, an optical character recognition program that can make reading Japanese text from visual novels much easier.\r\n\r\nNote: This program uses a command line interface. If you're looking for something with a GUI, consider using GameSentenceMiner which runs a fork of OwOCR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\rInstall Python (3.11, 3.12, or 3.13)\r\n   > Warning: During installation, make sure to select \"Add to Path\". If you skip this step, OwOCR will not work.\rOpen your command prompt/terminal and run:\rInstall Google Lens for best OCR accuracy:\r\n   \r\n\r\nOther providers:\rBing: pre-installed → key:  (close second best, recommended)\rApple Live Text: pre-installed → key:  (macOS only, includes vertical text support on Sonoma+)\rApple Vision: pre-installed → key:  (macOS only, best local engine on Mac)\rOneOCR:  → key:  (Windows 10/11, fast and accurate)\rManga OCR:  → key:  (good for vertical text)\rEasyOCR:  → key: \rRapidOCR:  → key: \rmeikiocr:  → key:  (fast local option, best for Linux, supports GPU acceleration with )\r\n\r\nFrom the GitHub: If using an online engine like Lens, the developer recommends setting a secondary local engine with :  on Windows,  on macOS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to use OwOCR: screen capture mode (recommended) or clipboard mode.\r\n\r\nScreen Capture Mode (Recommended)\r\n\r\nThis is the easiest way to get started. OwOCR captures directly from your screen with a hotkey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis starts OwOCR with Google Lens and opens an area selector when triggered. The recognized text is copied to your clipboard for dictionary lookup.\r\n\r\nCapture a specific window:\r\n\r\n\r\nReplace  with part of your game's window title. OwOCR will capture the first window that matches.\r\n\r\nCapture just part of a window:\r\n\r\n\r\nAdding  opens a selector to choose a specific area within that window. Useful when you only want to OCR the text box.\r\n\r\nRecommended Command\r\n\r\nFor the best experience with texthooker page integration and window targeting:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n| Flag | What it does |\r\n|------|--------------|\r\n|  | Use screen capture mode instead of clipboard monitoring |\r\n|  | Use Google Lens as the primary OCR engine (best accuracy) |\r\n|  | Use OneOCR as a secondary fallback engine for faster local processing. Windows only, use  on macOS |\r\n|  | Output text via WebSocket instead of clipboard |\r\n|  | Use port 6677 (same as Textractor, so your texthooker page works with both) |\r\n|  | Target a window containing this text in its title (locks onto the window) |\r\n|  | Opens a selector to choose a specific area within that window |\r\n\r\nReplace  with part of your game's window title.\r\n\r\nLauncher Script\r\n\r\nCreate a batch file (e.g., ) for easy one-click launching with window targeting:\r\n\r\nWarning: Don't name the file  or it will call itself instead of the actual program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis script prompts you to optionally enter a window title, then launches OwOCR with the recommended settings.\r\n\r\nClipboard Mode\r\n\r\nIf you prefer using a screenshot tool like ShareX, OwOCR can monitor your clipboard instead:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTake a screenshot that copies to clipboard, and OwOCR will automatically process it and replace the clipboard contents with the recognized text.\r\n\r\nShareX Configuration (Optional)\r\n\r\nIf you prefer clipboard mode with ShareX instead of OwOCR's built-in screen capture:\rRight-click the ShareX system tray icon → \"Hotkey settings\"\rClick \"Add\" to create a new hotkey\rSelect Capture Region or Capture Region (Light)\rSet your preferred hotkey (avoid keys games use, like Shift)\rClick the gear icon next to your hotkey\rUnder \"Task\" settings, enable \"Override after capture tasks\"\rSelect only \"Copy image to clipboard\" and disable everything else\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDictionary Integration\r\n\r\nJL\r\n\r\nJL is the recommended dictionary for OwOCR. It works with both clipboard and WebSocket input.\r\n\r\nFor the ShareX workflow (OCRing specific words for instant lookup), enable these settings:\rPreferences → Popup → Auto lookup the first term when it's copied from the clipboard\rPreferences → Popup → Auto lookup the first term when it's copied from a WebSocket\rPreferences → Popup → Don't auto look up the first term on text change if Main Window is not minimized\r\n\r\nThese settings let you OCR text and immediately see the definition without any extra clicks.\r\n\r\nYomitan\r\n\r\nEnable clipboard monitor in Yomitan, then click the magnifying glass to access the search page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBrowser Extensions\r\n\r\nFor texthooker page integration:\rLap Clipboard Inserter (Firefox)\rClipboard Inserter Redux (Chrome)\r\n\r\nWebSocket Support\r\n\r\nOwOCR can send text via WebSocket instead of clipboard:\rUse  to write text to WebSocket\rDefault port is 7331 (configurable in config file)\r\n\r\nRuntime Controls\r\n\r\nWhile OwOCR is running, you can use these keys:\r\n\r\n| Key | Action |\r\n|-----|--------|\r\n|  | Switch to Google Lens |\r\n|  | Switch to Manga OCR |\r\n|  | Switch to Bing |\r\n|  | Cycle through available engines |\r\n|  | Pause/resume OCR |\r\n|  or  | Quit the program |\r\n\r\nCommand Reference\r\n\r\nInput/Output Options\r\n\r\n| Option | Description |\r\n|--------|-------------|\r\n| ,  | Where to read images from: , , , , or a directory path |\r\n| ,  | Optional secondary input source |\r\n| ,  | Where to save text: , , or a file path |\r\n| ,  | OCR engine: , , , , , , , , , , , ,  |\r\n| ,  | Secondary local engine for two-pass processing |\r\n\r\nScreen Capture Options\r\n\r\n| Option | Description |\r\n|--------|-------------|\r\n| ,  | Target area: empty (selector), coordinates (), , or window name |\r\n| ,  | Subsection of window: empty (selector), coordinates, or  for whole window |\r\n| ,  | Delay between screenshots.  to disable periodic capture |\r\n| ,  | Only capture when target window is active |\r\n| ,  | Wait for stable text before processing.  waits for matching results,  disables |\r\n| ,  | Recover missed lines from unstable frames |\r\n| ,  | Regex to filter unwanted text (e.g., ) |\r\n| ,  | Hotkey combo for taking screenshots (e.g., ) |\r\n| ,  | Hotkey combo for changing capture area |\r\n\r\nText Processing Options\r\n\r\n| Option | Description |\r\n|--------|-------------|\r\n| ,  | Language code:  (Japanese),  (Chinese),  (Korean), etc. |\r\n| ,  | Remove spaces/separators between lines |\r\n| ,  | Remove spaces/separators between paragraphs |\r\n| ,  | Custom line separator (supports ) |\r\n| ,  | Custom paragraph separator |\r\n| ,  | Regroup and reorder text instead of using OCR engine order |\r\n| ,  | Filter furigana from Japanese text (requires ) |\r\n| ,  | Output format:  (default) or  (includes coordinates) |\r\n\r\nOther Options\r\n\r\n| Option | Description |\r\n|--------|-------------|\r\n| ,  | Start paused |\r\n| ,  | Delete images after processing (when reading from directory) |\r\n| ,  | Show OS notification with detected text |\r\n| ,  | Auto-pause after N seconds of no recognition.  to disable |\r\n| ,  | Hotkey combo for pause (e.g., ) |\r\n| ,  | Hotkey combo for switching engines |\r\n| ,  | WebSocket port (default: 7331) |\r\n| ,  | Delay between clipboard/directory checks |\r\n| ,  | Output verbosity:  (full text),  (timestamps only),  (errors only), or character limit |\r\n\r\nTips\rUse Google Lens for best accuracy in most cases\rAvoid hotkey conflicts with game controls\rMouse buttons work great as hotkeys if your mouse has extra buttons\rTest your setup on some Japanese text before starting a VN\rConfig file: You can store settings in  (Linux/macOS: )\r\n\r\nFor more details, see the OwOCR GitHub page.\r\n\r\nRelated Pages\r\n\r\nText Hooking Alternatives:\rTextractor Guide - Standard text hooking (try first if possible)\rAgent Guide - Script-based text hooker for stubborn games\r\n\r\nDictionary Setup:\rJL Dictionary Guide - Connect OCR output to popup dictionary\rComplete Beginner's Guide - Full learning roadmap\r\n\r\nMore Resources:\rTools Overview - See all available tools\rWhere to Get VNs - Find Japanese visual novels to practice with",

    "content": "ShaderGlass Guide\r\n\r\nThis guide covers ShaderGlass, a lightweight Windows overlay application that applies shader effects on top of your desktop or specific windows. It includes over 1,200 built-in shaders for CRT simulation, upscaling, and various visual effects.\r\n\r\nShaderGlass can work as a much lighter-weight alternative to Magpie if you don't need neural network upscaling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements\rWindows 10 (version 2004 / build 19041) or Windows 11\rDirectX 11 capable GPU\rA visual novel or game to enhance\r\n\r\nInstallation\rDownload the latest release from the ShaderGlass Releases page\rExtract the downloaded archive to a folder of your choice\rRun  to start the application\r\n\r\nBasic Usage\r\n\r\nOperating Modes\r\n\r\nShaderGlass has two main modes:\rDesktop Glass - A transparent floating window that applies shaders to anything behind it. With click-through enabled, this requires the least setup but can be resource intensive.\rWindow Clone - Captures and processes a specific application window. You can enlarge the clone window to upscale like Magpie, but you may need to adjust pixel size and shader settings for best results.\r\n\r\nYou can set a specific window as the input source under Input instead of your entire desktop, but not every application works well with this - some games may crash.\r\n\r\nQuick Start\rLaunch ShaderGlass\rLaunch your visual novel or game\rSelect your input source (Desktop or specific Window)\rChoose a shader from the library\rPosition the overlay over your game\r\n\r\nRecommended Shaders\r\n\r\nShaderGlass includes shaders from the RetroArch library. Try the random button under the Shaders tab to discover new shaders you might like.\r\n\r\nFor Retro VNs:\rCRT shaders - Emulate old CRT monitors (crt-royale, crt-geom, crt-lottes)\rScanline effects - Add authentic scanlines\r\n\r\nFor Upscaling:\rxBR / ScaleFX - Smooth pixel art upscaling\rSharp-Bilinear - Clean scaling for pixel art\r\n\r\nFor General Use:\rSharpening filters - Enhance clarity\rColor correction - Adjust colors and gamma\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n\r\nPixel Size Setting\r\n\r\nFor crisp results, set Input → Pixel Size to match your game's scaling. This ensures the shader processes pixels correctly.\r\n\r\nIf your text appears blurry, try adjusting the pixel size setting.\r\n\r\nPerformance Tips\rUse Window Clone mode for better performance\rSelect your dedicated GPU in the Processing settings if you have multiple graphics cards\rLower frame rate if experiencing performance issues\r\n\r\nSaving Profiles\r\n\r\nTo save your settings:\rGo to Processing → Save profile as\rChoose a name and location for your profile\r\n\r\nTo load a saved profile, select Processing → Load profile.\r\n\r\nYou can also set a default profile that loads automatically by pressing Set as default profile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRelated Pages\r\n\r\nDisplay Tools:\rMagpie Guide - Neural network upscaling for VNs\rTools Overview - See all available VN tools\r\n\r\nGetting Started:\rComplete Beginner's Guide - Full roadmap for learning Japanese with VNs\rWhere to Get VNs - Find visual novels to play",

    "content": "Where to Get Japanese Visual Novels\r\n\r\nThis page lists sources to buy or download untranslated Japanese VNs, whether commercial or doujin.\r\n\r\nNote: Many of these sites are in Japanese and may feature explicit content. Some stores require Japanese payment methods or addresses.\r\n\r\nCommercial Stores\r\n\r\nRecommended:\rDLsite  \r\n  Massive library of indie/doujin and commercial VNs. Has adult and all-ages sections. Accepts overseas payments. Pages with certain tags may be region blocked, but this can be bypassed with a VPN. Generally recommended for most overseas customers.\r\n\r\nOther Sources:\rDMM / FANZA  \r\n  Major distributor of digital VNs and eroge. Often includes trials and discounts.\rGetchu  \r\n  Online store for physical and digital eroge. Often used for preorders.\rGyutto  \r\n  Another digital platform with a wide range of VNs and doujin games.\rMelonbooks  \r\n  Focused on doujin goods and games. Some digital VNs available, especially short/experimental titles. Making an account requires a Japanese phone number.\rBooth (by Pixiv)\r\n  Doujin creators sometimes sell short VNs here. Search for ノベル or ADV tags and check the PCゲーム category.\r\n\r\nFree Doujin Visual Novels\rNovelGame.jp  \r\n  Free platform for indie/doujin VNs. Often made with TyranoScript. Search by tag, rating, play length, etc.\rFreem!\r\n  Hosts a wide variety of Japanese free games, including visual novels and hybrids. Check the ノベルゲーム category or search manually.\r\n\r\nWeb-Based Games\rThe Asenheim Project  \r\n  Web-based visual novel project that lets you play retro games in your browser.\rTsukiWeb  \r\n  Web-based implementation of Tsukihime. Go to Config > Advanced > Language in order to enable Japanese text.\rFate/Stay Night Web  \r\n  Web-based implementation of Fate/Stay Night. In order to play in Japanese, press ESC to open the settings menu and set the language to 日本語.\rKichikuou Web  \r\n  Site that allows you to play Kichikuou Rance in your browser. Requires that you provide your own CD-ROM image file to play. Might be a good idea to check out the Internet Archive.\rVNPocket\r\n  Web-based platform hosting mainly doujin eroge with some visual novels that can be played directly in your browser.\r\n\r\nArchives & Preservation\r\n\r\nThese are listed for preservation/discovery purposes only. Please support creators when possible :)\r\n\r\nRecommended:\rAnime-Sharing — Forum-based hub for sharing VNs and related media. Many releases originate here and are often clean rips from DLsite. Focuses on DDL sharing, but offers torrents as well. Make sure to sort by new to find working links.\rNyaa.si — Public torrent tracker with many visual novels. Check here for popular SFW titles.\rSukebei Nyaa — NSFW side of of Nyaa, popular for eroge and nukige uploads.\rShinnku — Chinese visual novel resource site offering a wide range of Japanese titles. The site is organized, regularly updated, and supports downloads for Windows, Android, and other platforms. Check out the 生肉集合 section for raw VNs sorted by release date. Games are marked as 生肉 (raw/untranslated) or 熟肉 (translated) next to the file size on both the search page and individual game pages.\rH-Suki — Adult-oriented DDL site with VN downloads and patches. Great for older and rare titles. Impressive PC-98 collection. Requires a login to download, but links from here tend to last for a while.\rInternet Archive — Huge digital library. Great for older obscure titles. The Neo Kobe collection is an essential for anyone interested in PC-98 games.\r\n\r\nOther Sources:\rAnimeBytes — Private torrent tracker with a games section. Invite required. For some reason, doujin works are not allowed, so generally not the best source for rare titles.\rRyuugames — Frequently updated blog with links to Japanese VNs. Keep in mind that their \"Japanese (Raw)\" section doesn't actually filter out translated games. May be more convenient than other sources due to the inclusion of Google Drive and OneDrive links.\rzi0.cc — Chinese DDL site with a lot of raw games. Sorted using a folder structure similar to Shinnku. Includes collections sorted by developer. Avoid games in the \"汉化galgame会社合集\" folder or releases with \"汉化\" in the name as those are translated.\rMikocon — Chinese forum-style site with a section for Japanese eroge and VNs. Useful source for finding cracks for games with DRM, as many of them originate here.\rGGBases — Chinese mirror of Nyaa with added metadata like tags, images, and CG gallery links. May help with browsing or previewing content.\rTouchGal — Chinese galgame resource that provides direct download links. Games tagged as \"日本語\" or \"生肉资源\" are in Japanese. You can filter by language on the search page.\rGalDL — Chinese galgame resource that provides torrent links. Check the オリジナル版 tab for raw games.\rbt.orzx.im — Chinese torrent board hosting \"2D. G.F.\" releases, often including VNs, CG sets, and other otaku content.\rJapanese PC Compendium — Site dedicated to retro Japanese computers that provides mediafire links to old games on various platforms. Check out the adventure category for VN-style games.\rRyuublogger — Similar to Ryuugames, but appears inactive.\rAkiba-Online — Another DDL forum similar to Anime-sharing.\rHentai-Sharing — DDL site that clones releases from Anime-sharing. May have working links when the originals go down.\rHentai-Share — Another DDL site that copies releases from Anime-sharing.\rVivaHentai4u — Same as above.\rOtomi Games — Another DDL site.\rHentai4Daily — Another one.\rDoujinblog — One more.\r\n\r\nLooking for console games? Check out the r/ROMs megathread for everything you need.\r\n\r\nGeneral Search Tips\rUse exact search terms  \r\n  Searching the game title in quotes (e.g.  or ) can help surface direct links. Quotes force an exact match in most search engines.\rTry using romaji  \r\n  Some uploads only use romaji instead of kanji/kana. Searching both versions can yield different results.\rUse multiple search engines  \r\n  Google doesn’t always show everything. DuckDuckGo or Bing can sometimes uncover links that don’t appear elsewhere.\rCheck VNDB release pages  \r\n  For doujin or lesser-known visual novels, the VNDB releases page or discussions tab might list file names or host links. Users sometimes upload to MEGA and only share the link there without a homepage.\rUse adblock\r\n  Many file hosting or third-party download pages are overloaded with misleading ads or popups. Using uBlock Origin is strongly recommended for safety and sanity.\r\n\r\nNotes on Premium Links\r\n\r\nDDL sites (like Anime-Sharing or Mikocon) host links on cloud services such as:\rMega.nz  \rRapidgator  \rMediaFire  \rPixeldrain  \rMixdrop\r\n\r\nThese are often called “premium links” or “mirror links\" and some may either throttle download speeds or prevent downloading without a premium account.\r\n\r\nTips:\rLinks may go down over time. Try alternate mirrors or check newer posts.  \rSome links have limits (e.g. Google Drive quota).  \rOccasionally, these are behind shortlink redirects or ad pages. Skip them carefully, and avoid clicking on any ads.  \rDownload managers like JDownloader or Motrix can help with bulk or large downloads by merging split releases and automatically handling file extraction.  \rUse a VPN if links are region-locked.\r\n\r\nThese mirrors are one reason sites like Shinnku or Ryuugames may be more convenient than older DDL forums. If you are committed to being a free user, these tools may help you bypass certain restrictions. If you are someone like me who downloads obscure games frequently, pairing a debrid service like Real-Debrid or Debrid-Link with JDownloader may be ideal. However, this is not recommended for the average user. Do not let anyone convince you that you must spend a lot of money to learn with your favorite games. It is often simply a matter of finding the right link.\r\n\r\nNotes on Buying from Japan\rYou may need a Japanese address (e.g. Tenso) or proxy service (e.g. Zenmarket, Neokyo, Buyee, White Rabbit).  \rMost proxy services will refuse to buy digital goods, but you can always check with their customer support.  \rSome stores do not sell to overseas accounts. Use a Japanese VPN or proxy if needed.\r\n\r\nRelated Pages\r\n\r\nBefore You Download:\rWhere to Find VNs - Discover and research visual novels on VNDB\r\n\r\nAfter You Download:\rTextractor Setup - Extract text from VNs for dictionary lookups\rJL Dictionary Guide - Set up popup dictionary for reading\rComplete Beginner's Guide - Full learning roadmap\r\n\r\nDownload Tools:\rJDownloader Guide - Automate downloading from file hosts\rTools Overview - All available tools for VN reading",

These correspond to 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Textractor.\rUse  for most games.\rUse  for modern visual novels that don't work with the x86 version.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Install the WebSocket Extension\r\n\r\nDownload the WebSocket extension from the Releases page of the  repository.\r\n\r\nFile Setup\rUnzip the release package.\rCopy  into your  folder.\rCopy  into your  folder.\r\n\r\nAdd Extensions to Textractor\r\n\r\nFor :\rOpen \rClick the Extensions button (left sidebar).\rRight-click in the Extensions window → Add Extension\rIn the file picker:\rChange the file type to \rSelect \r\n\r\nFor :\rOpen \rRepeat the same steps above using \r\n\r\nTip: You can remove any unhelpful extensions (like extra new lines) from your Extensions list. My settings are provided below for reference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 3: Hook the Visual Novel\rLaunch your visual novel and get to a point where you can start loading text.\rOpen the matching version of Textractor ( or ) based on your game.\rIn Textractor, click \"Attach to game\" in the top-left to open the process list.\rSelect the visual novel’s process.\r\n\r\n    > 🛠 If the game doesn’t appear in the list, try running Textractor as Administrator.\rAdvance the VN by a few lines to generate text for Textractor to capture.\rUse the top dropdown in Textractor (where it says \"Console\") and press up and down to cycle through the hooks.\rFind a hook that accurately reflects the game's text.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf textractor can't automatically find a working hook, you can try searching manually by selecting \"Search for hooks\" or checking the discussion tab of the game's VNDB page to see if anyone has listed a working hook code.\r\n\r\nHow to View Text in the Browser\rOpen Renji-XD's Texthooker UI or Kizuna Texthooker in your browser. If the WebSocket is working, the colored icon in the top right should be green. If it's still red, trying clicking on it to reconnect.\rClick the Start button in the top-right corner. (Or enable \"Allow new Line during Pause\" and \"Autostart Timer by Line during Pause\" in the settings.)\rOnce Textractor is hooked and sending text, the UI will display it in real time.\rThe WebSocket server will be automatically started by Textractor at:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nThis allows the texthooker UI to receive text directly from Textractor using the WebSocket extension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUseful Regex Patterns\r\n\r\nBelow are common regular expressions you can use to clean up text captured by Textractor. These patterns can be used with the Textractor \"Regex Filter\" and \"Regex Replacer\" extensions, texthooking pages, or any text processing tool that supports regex.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Use RegExr to test and refine these patterns with your specific examples before applying them.\rRemove bracketed speaker tags\r\n\r\nExample:  → \rRemove everything before a name tag\r\n\r\nExample:  → \rStrip ruby/furigana\r\n\r\nExample:  → \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKeep base text with leading pipe:  → \r\n\r\nReplace with: \rRemove timestamps\r\n\r\nExample:  → \rNormalize spaces and newlines\r\n\r\nExample:  → \r\n\r\n\r\nReplace with:  (single space)\r\n\r\nCollapse repeated newlines:\r\n\r\nReplace with: \rRemove control characters\r\n\r\nExample: Remove invisible control characters\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\rNames that include punctuation (will be matched by the simple name patterns)\rGames using non-standard brackets or custom markup\rMake sure to test patterns on sample text before you continue reading\r\n\r\nAdditional Tips\rKeep both  and  folders ready — the version depends on the VN.\rSome games may not hook correctly if you set Textractor to automatically use a saved hook. Try restarting the game or clicking \"Forget game\".\rIf you don't see text in the UI, check that:\rThe WebSocket extension is installed correctly.\rTextractor is actually hooked to the VN.\rYou're using a supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, Brave etc.).\rYour firewall settings and browser extensions aren't blocking the WebSocket connection.\r\n\r\nRelated Pages\r\n\r\nGetting Started & Learning:\rComplete Beginner's Guide – Full roadmap for learning Japanese with VNs\rMining Vocabulary Section – How to mine words efficiently\r\n\r\nDictionary & Mining Integration:\rJL Dictionary Setup – Pop-up dictionary + Anki mining\rTools Overview – Summary of all recommended tools\r\n\r\nAlternative Text Acquisition:\rAgent Guide – Script-based advanced text hooking (use when Textractor struggles)\rOwOCR Guide – OCR fallback for unhookable games\r\n\r\nFinding Visual Novels:**\rWhere to Get VNs – Download sources\rFinding VNs on VNDB – Discover and choose new titles",
