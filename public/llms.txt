> Learn Japanese with visual novels. Comprehensive guides, tools, VNDB browser, and community resources for immersion-based Japanese learning through VNs.

VN Club is a resource site for learning Japanese through visual novels (VNs). It provides step-by-step guides for text hooking, popup dictionaries, Anki mining, and other tools needed to read Japanese VNs. The site also features a VNDB browser, personalized recommendations, quizzes, and aggregated VN news.

The philosophy is immersion-first: read the original Japanese text from the start, using tools to assist comprehension rather than relying on translations.
