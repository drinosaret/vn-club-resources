# GameHub Lite Setup Guide

[GameHub Lite](https://github.com/Producdevity/gamehub-lite) is a free, community-maintained Android app that lets you play Windows games on your phone or tablet. It's a privacy-focused modification of the GameHub emulator with telemetry removed and no login required.

That's it! Most visual novels work out of the box with no additional configuration needed.

## Controls

GameHub Lite uses touch controls by default:

- **Tap** to left-click
- **Two-finger tap** to right-click

### Disabling Touch Overlay

## Tips and Limitations

- If a game runs slowly, try closing background apps or lowering in-game resolution
- Keep your device plugged in during longer sessions as emulation is battery-intensive
