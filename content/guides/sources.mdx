# Where to Get Japanese Visual Novels

This page lists sources to **buy or download untranslated Japanese VNs**, whether commercial or doujin.

> Note: Many of these sites are in Japanese and may feature explicit content. Some stores require Japanese payment methods or addresses.

## Commercial Stores

**Recommended:**

- **[DLsite](https://www.dlsite.com/)**  
  Massive library of indie/doujin and commercial VNs. Has adult and all-ages sections. Accepts overseas payments. Pages with certain tags may be region blocked, but this can be bypassed with a VPN. Generally recommended for most overseas customers.

**Other Sources:**

  Focused on doujin goods and games. Some digital VNs available, especially short/experimental titles. Making an account requires a Japanese phone number.

- [Booth (by Pixiv)](https://booth.pm/)
  Doujin creators sometimes sell short VNs here. Search for ノベル or ADV tags and check the PCゲーム category.

## Free Doujin Visual Novels

- [NovelGame.jp](https://novelgame.jp/)  
  Free platform for indie/doujin VNs. Often made with TyranoScript. Search by tag, rating, play length, etc.

- [Freem!](https://www.freem.ne.jp/)
  Hosts a wide variety of Japanese free games, including visual novels and hybrids. Check the ノベルゲーム category or search manually.

## Web-Based Games

  Web-based visual novel project that lets you play retro games in your browser.

## Archives & Preservation

> These are listed for **preservation/discovery purposes only**. Please support creators when possible :)

**Recommended:**

- **[Anime-Sharing](https://www.anime-sharing.com/)** — Forum-based hub for sharing VNs and related media. Many releases originate here and are often clean rips from DLsite. Focuses on DDL sharing, but offers torrents as well. Make sure to sort by new to find working links.

- **[Nyaa.si](https://nyaa.si/)** — Public torrent tracker with many visual novels. Check here for popular SFW titles.

- **[Sukebei Nyaa](https://sukebei.nyaa.si/)** — NSFW side of of Nyaa, popular for eroge and nukige uploads.

- **[Shinnku](https://www.shinnku.com/)** — Chinese visual novel resource site offering a wide range of Japanese titles. The site is organized, regularly updated, and supports downloads for Windows, Android, and other platforms. Check out the [生肉集合](https://www.shinnku.com/files/galgame0) section for raw VNs sorted by release date. Games are marked as 生肉 (raw/untranslated) or 熟肉 (translated) next to the file size on both the search page and individual game pages.

- **[H-Suki](https://www.h-suki.com/en/home)** — Adult-oriented DDL site with VN downloads and patches. Great for older and rare titles. Impressive PC-98 collection. Requires a login to download, but links from here tend to last for a while.

- **[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/)** — Huge digital library. Great for older obscure titles. The [Neo Kobe](https://archive.org/details/NeoKobe-NecPc-98012017-11-17) collection is an essential for anyone interested in PC-98 games.

**Other Sources:**

- [AnimeBytes](https://animebytes.tv/) — Private torrent tracker with a games section. Invite required. For some reason, doujin works are not allowed, so generally not the best source for rare titles.

- [Ryuugames](https://www.ryuugames.com/) — Frequently updated blog with links to Japanese VNs. Keep in mind that their "Japanese (Raw)" section doesn't actually filter out translated games. May be more convenient than other sources due to the inclusion of Google Drive and OneDrive links.

- [zi0.cc](https://zi0.cc/) — Chinese DDL site with a lot of raw games. Sorted using a folder structure similar to Shinnku. Includes collections sorted by developer. Avoid games in the "汉化galgame会社合集" folder or releases with "汉化" in the name as those are translated.

- [Mikocon](https://www.mikocon.com/) — Chinese forum-style site with a section for Japanese eroge and VNs. Useful source for finding cracks for games with DRM, as many of them originate here.

- [GGBases](https://www.ggbases.com) — Chinese mirror of Nyaa with added metadata like tags, images, and CG gallery links. May help with browsing or previewing content.

- [TouchGal](https://www.touchgal.us) — Chinese galgame resource that provides direct download links. Games tagged as "日本語" or "生肉资源" are in Japanese. You can filter by language on the search page.

- [GalDL](https://www.galdl.com) — Chinese galgame resource that provides torrent links. Check the オリジナル版 tab for raw games.

- [bt.orzx.im](https://bt.orzx.im/list.php?BoardID=5) — Chinese torrent board hosting "2D. G.F." releases, often including VNs, CG sets, and other otaku content.

- [Japanese PC Compendium](https://japanesepccompendium.blogspot.com) — Site dedicated to retro Japanese computers that provides mediafire links to old games on various platforms. Check out the adventure category for VN-style games.

- [Ryuublogger](https://ryuubloggerv2.blogspot.com) — Similar to Ryuugames, but appears inactive.
  
- [Akiba-Online](https://www.akiba-online.com/forums/hentai-game-downloads.41/) — Another DDL forum similar to Anime-sharing.

- [Hentai-Sharing](https://hentai-sharing.net/) — DDL site that clones releases from Anime-sharing. May have working links when the originals go down.

- [Hentai-Share](https://hentai-share.com/) — Another DDL site that copies releases from Anime-sharing.

- [VivaHentai4u](https://www.vivahentai4u.net/) — Same as above.

- [Otomi Games](https://otomi-games.com) — Another DDL site.

- [Hentai4Daily](https://hentai4daily.com/) — Another one.

- [Doujinblog](https://doujinblog.org/) — One more.

## General Search Tips

- **Use exact search terms**  
  Searching the game title in quotes (e.g. `"game title" "download"` or `"game title" "Rapidgator"`) can help surface direct links. Quotes force an exact match in most search engines.

- **Try using romaji**  
  Some uploads only use romaji instead of kanji/kana. Searching both versions can yield different results.

- **Use multiple search engines**  
  Google doesn’t always show everything. DuckDuckGo or Bing can sometimes uncover links that don’t appear elsewhere.

- **Check VNDB release pages**  
  For doujin or lesser-known visual novels, the VNDB releases page or discussions tab might list file names or host links. Users sometimes upload to MEGA and only share the link there without a homepage.

- **Use adblock**
  Many file hosting or third-party download pages are overloaded with misleading ads or popups. Using [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) is strongly recommended for safety and sanity.

## Notes on Premium Links

DDL sites (like Anime-Sharing or Mikocon) host links on cloud services such as:

- Mega.nz  
- Rapidgator  
- MediaFire  
- Pixeldrain  
- Mixdrop

These are often called “premium links” or “mirror links" and some may either throttle download speeds or prevent downloading without a premium account.

**Tips:**

- Links may go down over time. Try alternate mirrors or check newer posts.  
- Some links have limits (e.g. Google Drive quota).  
- Occasionally, these are behind shortlink redirects or ad pages. Skip them carefully, and avoid clicking on any ads.  
- Download managers like [JDownloader](/jdownloader-guide) or [Motrix](https://github.com/agalwood/Motrix) can help with bulk or large downloads by merging split releases and automatically handling file extraction.  
- Use a VPN if links are region-locked.

These mirrors are one reason sites like Shinnku or Ryuugames may be more convenient than older DDL forums. If you are committed to being a free user, these [tools](https://filehostlist.miraheze.org/wiki/Free_Premium_Leeches#Guide) may help you bypass certain restrictions. If you are someone like me who downloads obscure games frequently, pairing a debrid service like [Real-Debrid](https://real-debrid.com/) or [Debrid-Link](https://debrid-link.com/) with JDownloader may be ideal. However, this is not recommended for the average user. Do not let anyone convince you that you must spend a lot of money to learn with your favorite games. It is often simply a matter of finding the right link.

## Notes on Buying from Japan

- You may need a Japanese address (e.g. [Tenso](https://www.tenso.com/)) or proxy service (e.g. Zenmarket, Neokyo, Buyee, White Rabbit).  
- Most proxy services will refuse to buy digital goods, but you can always check with their customer support.  
- Some stores **do not sell to overseas accounts**. Use a Japanese VPN or proxy if needed.
