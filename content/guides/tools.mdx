# Useful Tools

Essential tools and utilities to enhance your visual novel reading experience, from text extraction to productivity improvements.

## Dictionaries

- **[JL](https://github.com/rampaa/JL)** — The hover dictionary program made specifically for VN readers. | [Guide](/jl-guide)
- **[Yomitan](https://yomitan.wiki/)** — The browser based dictionary extension that everyone loves.
  - **[Marv's Yomitan Dictionaries](https://github.com/MarvNC/yomitan-dictionaries)** — Comprehensive collection of Yomitan-compatible dictionaries. Get your monolingual dictionaries, frequency lists, and more here.

## Text Hookers

- **[Textractor (Chenx211 Fork)](https://github.com/Chenx221/Textractor)** — Modern fork of the classic texthooker. Best for most modern Windows VNs. | [Guide](/textractor-guide)
- **[Agent](https://github.com/0xDC00/agent)** — Script-based texthooker used for cases where normal text-hookers won't work. Many scripts for emulated games are available. | [Guide](/agent-guide)

- **[LunaTranslator](https://github.com/HIllya51/LunaTranslator)** — More bloated than all of the other options, but may work when the others fail and does have legitimately useful features.
