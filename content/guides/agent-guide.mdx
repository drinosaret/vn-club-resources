# Agent Guide

This guide walks you through setting up and using **Agent**, a universal script-based text hooker powered by FRIDA. Agent is designed for extracting text from visual novels and games across various platforms including PC games, emulators, and Unity games. Despite the simple UI, Agent is a powerful tool for hooking games that might not work with textractor.

## Usage

### Basic Operation

1. **Select Target**: To select a target, you can supply a file directory to an exe file or you can more simply click and drag the target icon on to your target game. Clicking the dropdown menu next to the target icon and selecting "Create Process" will bring up a file picker allowing you to select a target.
