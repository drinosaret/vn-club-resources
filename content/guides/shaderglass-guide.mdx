# ShaderGlass Guide

This guide covers [ShaderGlass](https://github.com/mausimus/ShaderGlass), a lightweight Windows overlay application that applies shader effects on top of your desktop or specific windows. It includes over 1,200 built-in shaders for CRT simulation, upscaling, and various visual effects.

ShaderGlass can work as a much lighter-weight alternative to Magpie if you don't need neural network upscaling. For more detailed information, see the [official ShaderGlass manual](https://mausimus.github.io/ShaderGlass/MANUAL.html).

## Requirements

- **Windows 10** (version 2004 / build 19041) or **Windows 11**
- **DirectX 11** capable GPU
- A visual novel or game to enhance

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [ShaderGlass Releases page](https://github.com/mausimus/ShaderGlass/releases)
2. Extract the downloaded archive to a folder of your choice
3. Run `ShaderGlass.exe` to start the application

## Basic Usage

### Operating Modes

ShaderGlass has two main modes:

- **Desktop Glass** - A transparent floating window that applies shaders to anything behind it. With click-through enabled, this requires the least setup but can be resource intensive.
- **Window Clone** - Captures and processes a specific application window. You can enlarge the clone window to upscale like Magpie, but you may need to adjust pixel size and shader settings for best results.

You can set a specific window as the input source under **Input** instead of your entire desktop, but not every application works well with this - some games may crash.

### Quick Start

1. Launch ShaderGlass
2. Launch your visual novel or game
3. Select your input source (Desktop or specific Window)
4. Choose a shader from the library
5. Position the overlay over your game

### Recommended Shaders

ShaderGlass includes shaders from the RetroArch library. Try the **random button** under the Shaders tab to discover new shaders you might like.

**For Retro VNs:**
- **CRT shaders** - Emulate old CRT monitors (crt-royale, crt-geom, crt-lottes)
- **Scanline effects** - Add authentic scanlines

**For Upscaling:**
- **xBR / ScaleFX** - Smooth pixel art upscaling
- **Sharp-Bilinear** - Clean scaling for pixel art

**For General Use:**
- **Sharpening filters** - Enhance clarity
- **Color correction** - Adjust colors and gamma

## Configuration

### Pixel Size Setting

For crisp results, set **Input → Pixel Size** to match your game's scaling. This ensures the shader processes pixels correctly.

If your text appears blurry, try adjusting the pixel size setting.

### Performance Tips

- Use **Window Clone** mode for better performance
- Select your dedicated GPU in the Processing settings if you have multiple graphics cards
- Lower frame rate if experiencing performance issues

### Saving Profiles

To save your settings:

1. Go to **Processing → Save profile as**
2. Choose a name and location for your profile

To load a saved profile, select **Processing → Load profile**.

You can also set a default profile that loads automatically by pressing **Set as default profile**.
