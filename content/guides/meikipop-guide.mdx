# Meikipop Guide

[Meikipop](https://github.com/rtr46/meikipop) is an incredibly fast OCR popup dictionary that lets you look up Japanese text anywhere on your screen. Point your mouse at any Japanese text, press a hotkey, and get instant dictionary definitions. Magic.

Unlike browser extensions, Meikipop works with any on-screen text.

## Installation

### Prebuilt Binaries (Recommended)

1. Download the latest release from the [Meikipop Releases page](https://github.com/rtr46/meikipop/releases)
2. Extract the archive to a folder of your choice
3. Run the executable

The prebuilt binaries include the dictionary, so no additional setup is required.

### From Source

Requires **Python 3.10+**.

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install lxml
   ```
3. Build the dictionary:
   ```bash
   python -m scripts.build_dictionary
   ```
4. Run:
   ```bash
   python -m src.main
   ```

### macOS Permissions

macOS users need to grant the following permissions in System Preferences:
- **Input Monitoring** - For hotkey detection
- **Screen Recording** - For capturing screen content
- **Accessibility** - For mouse position tracking

## Basic Usage

![Meikipop terminal window](assets/meikipop-terminal.webp)

1. **Launch the application** - A system tray icon will appear
2. **Select scan region** - On first run, you'll be prompted to select a screen region to scan
3. **Position your mouse** over Japanese text you want to look up
4. **Press and hold the hotkey** (Shift by default)
5. **View the popup** - Dictionary results appear instantly
6. **Release the hotkey** to hide the popup

Right-click the system tray icon to access settings and options.

## Configuration

Access settings through the system tray icon's right-click menu. Configuration is saved to `config.ini` in the application folder.

**Available options:**
- **Hotkeys** - Change the trigger key
- **Themes and colors** - Customize the popup appearance
- **Scan region** - Switch between region-specific or fullscreen scanning
- **Auto scan mode** - Enable continuous scanning without holding the hotkey
- **OCR provider** - Choose between Google Lens, meikiocr (local), or [OwOCR](/owocr-guide) (WebSocket)

## Anki Mining Fork

If you want to create Anki cards directly from Meikipop, check out [pnotisdev's fork](https://github.com/pnotisdev/meikipop). It adds:

- **Anki card creation** (Alt+A) - Captures screenshots and context sentences
- **Duplicate detection** - Prevents adding words already in your deck
- **Automated audio** - Fetches audio from languagepod101.com
- **Additional shortcuts** - Alt+C to copy text, Alt+J for Jisho
- **More dictionaries** - Supports monolingual dictionaries like [kaikki](https://yomidevs.github.io/kaikki-to-yomitan/)

!!! note
    This fork has no prebuilt releases - you'll need to [build it from source](#from-source).

## Limitations

The original Meikipop is focused specifically on dictionary lookups. It does not support:
- SRS flashcard mining (use [JL](/jl-guide) or the [Anki fork above](#anki-mining-fork))
- Multiple dictionaries simultaneously

## Tips

- **Auto scan mode** is useful for games where text changes frequently and you want continuous lookups
- Particularly useful for JRPGs with complex menus where text appears all over the screen, compared to VNs where text is usually in a predictable location
- For games that can be text hooked, consider using [Textractor](/textractor-guide) + [JL](/jl-guide) instead
- Click the system tray icon to quickly toggle Meikipop on/off
