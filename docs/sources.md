## üì¶ Notes on Premium Links

DDL sites (like Anime-Sharing or Mikocon) host links on cloud services such as:

- Mega.nz
- Rapidgator
- MediaFire
- Pixeldrain
- Mixdrop

These are often called ‚Äúpremium links‚Äù or ‚Äúmirror links" and some may either throttle download speeds or prevent downloading without a premium account.

**Tips:**

- Links may go down over time. Try alternate mirrors or check newer posts.
- Some links have limits (e.g. Google Drive quota).
- Occasionally, these are behind shortlink redirects or ad pages. Skip them carefully, and avoid clicking on any ads.
- Download managers like <a href="https://jdownloader.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JDownloader</a> or <a href="https://github.com/agalwood/Motrix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Motrix</a> can help with bulk or large downloads by merging split releases and automatically handling file extraction.
- Use a VPN if links are region-locked.

These mirrors are one reason sites like Ryuugames may be more convenient than older DDL forums. If you are commited to being a free user, the tools <a href="https://filehostlist.miraheze.org/wiki/Free_Premium_Leeches#Guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> may help you bypass certain restrictions. If you are someone like me who downloads obscure games frequently, pairing a debrid service like <a href="https://real-debrid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Real-Debrid</a> or <a href="https://debrid-link.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Debrid-Link</a> with Jdownloader may be ideal. However, this is not reccomended for the average user. Do not let anyone convince you that you must spend money to learn with your favorite games. It is often simply a matter of finding the right link.

## üí≥ Notes on Buying from Japan

- You may need a Japanese address (e.g. <a href="https://www.tenso.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tenso</a>) or proxy service (e.g. Zenmarket, Neokyo, Buyee, White Rabbit).
- Most proxy services will refuse to buy digital goods, but you can always check with their customer support.
- Some stores **do not sell to overseas accounts**. Use a Japanese VPN or proxy if needed.
