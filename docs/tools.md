# üß∞ Useful Tools

Essential tools and utilities to enhance your visual novel reading experience, from text extraction to productivity improvements.

## üß† Text Hookers

- **[Textractor (Chenx211 Fork)](https://github.com/Chenx221/Textractor)** ‚Äî Modern fork of the classic texthooker. Best for most modern Windows VNs. | [Guide](textractor-guide.md)
- **[Agent](https://github.com/0xDC00/agent)** ‚Äî Script-based texthooker used for cases where normal text-hookers won't work. Many scripts for emulated games are available. | [Guide](agent-guide.md)
- **[ITHVNR](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13aHF4uIXWn-3YML_k2YCDWhtGgn5-tnO/view)** ‚Äî Replaced by textractor, but supposedly may work better with certain older games.
- **[LunaTranslator](https://github.com/HIllya51/LunaTranslator)** ‚Äî More bloated than all of the other options, but may work when the others fail and does have legitimately useful features. Apparently controversial for stealing code from Agent and Textractor, but must be included as a more modern texthooker. You better turn off the MTL if you actually intend to learn anything.
