# ðŸ§° Tools for Reading VNs

## ðŸ§  Text Hookers

- <a href="https://github.com/Chenx221/Textractor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Textractor (Chenx211 Fork)</a> â€” Modern fork of the classic texthooker. Best for most modern Windows VNs.
- <a href="https://github.com/0xDC00/agent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agent</a> â€” Script-based texthooker used for cases where normal text-hookers won't work. Many scripts for emulated games (especially N#nt#n#o Sw#tc# games) are available.
- <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13aHF4uIXWn-3YML_k2YCDWhtGgn5-tnO/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ITHVNR</a> â€” Replaced by textractor, but supposedly may work better with certain older games.
- <a href="https://github.com/HIllya51/LunaTranslator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LunaTranslator</a> â€” More bloated than all of the other options, but may work when the others fail and does have legitimately useful features. Apparently controversial for stealing code from Agent and Textractor, but must be included as a more modern texthooker. You better turn off the MTL.

## ðŸ“– Dictionaries

- <a href="https://yomitan.wiki/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yomitan</a> â€” The browser based dictionary extension that everyone loves.
- <a href="https://github.com/rampaa/JL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JL</a> â€” The hover dictionary program made specifically for VN readers.
