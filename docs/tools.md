Essential tools and utilities to enhance your visual novel reading experience, from text extraction to productivity improvements.

## üß† Text Hookers

- **[Textractor (Chenx211 Fork)](https://github.com/Chenx221/Textractor)** ‚Äî Modern fork of the classic texthooker. Best for most modern Windows VNs. | [Guide](textractor-guide.md)

- **[LunaTranslator](https://github.com/HIllya51/LunaTranslator)** ‚Äî More bloated than all of the other options, but may work when the others fail and does have legitimately useful features.
